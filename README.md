About
=====

The FFT Infrastructure Benchmark for Exascale Research (FIBER) provides a framework for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) benchmarks targeting exascale computing systems. It evaluates performance and scalability of distributed FFTs on different architectures. Furthermore, it analyzes the effect on applications that directly depend on FFTs. It can also stress and test the overall network of a supercomputer, give an indication on bisection bandwidth, noise, and other network and MPI collectives limitations that are of interest to many other ECP applications.


The current harness software allows to compute 3-D complex-to-complex and real-to-complex FFTs.

Setting up
==========

Create a folder; e.g., `Benchmarks_FFT`, and install the FFT libraries to benchmark.

~~~
-- Benchmarks_FFT
        |-- heFFTe
        |-- fftMPI
        |-- AccFFT
        |-- P3DFFT
        |-- FFTE
        |-- SWFFT
        |-- 2DECOMP&FFT
        |-- nb3dFFT
        |-- FFTW
~~~

Current libraries targeted by FIBER:
- CPU support: [fftMPI](https://lammps.github.io/fftmpi/), [SWFFT](https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/hacc/SWFFT), 
[P3DFFT](https://github.com/sdsc/p3dfft.3),
[nb3dFFT](https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/goebbert/nb3dfft),
[2DECOMP&FFT](http://www.2decomp.org/download.html)

- CPU-GPU support: [heFFTe](https://bitbucket.org/icl/heffte), [AccFFT](https://github.com/amirgholami/accfft),   [FFTE](http://www.ffte.jp/)


Compilation
===========

Next clone this repository and create  build folder, and execute the `cmake` commands.
In the following example, we install FIBER with heFFTe and fftMPI backends:

~~~
mkdir build; cd $_
build/
cmake -DFIBER_FFT_LIB_DIRS="/home/Benchmarks_FFT/fftmpi/src;/home/heffte/build/lib"
-DFIBER_FFT_INCLUDE_DIRS="/home/Benchmarks_FFT/fftmpi/src;/home/heffte/build/include"
-DFIBER_ENABLE_HEFFTE=ON -DFIBER_ENABLE_FFTMPI=ON
-DMPI_DIR=/sw/openmpi/4.0.0/ .. 
make -j
~~~

List the `lib` and `include` folders of libraries to test, respectively, in `FIBER_FFT_LIB_DIRS` and `FIBER_FFT_INCLUDE_DIRS`.

First experiments
=================

Run tests as follows:
~~~
cd build/benchmarks
mpirun -n 2 ./test3D_CPU_C2C <library>
mpirun -n 2 ./test3D_CPU_R2C <library>
~~~

where `library` has to be replaced by one of the nine available libraries, provided user has it installed.
Once a parallel FFT library has been correctly integrated to heFFTe, running these benchmarks should report a correct validation output.


Documentation
